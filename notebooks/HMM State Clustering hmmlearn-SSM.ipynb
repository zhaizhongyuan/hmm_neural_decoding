    "# HMM State Clustering\n",
    "In this notebook we'll explore a post-hoc method for clustering HMM states.\n",
    "The idea is, given an HMM which has been fit to data, we reduce the number of states hierarchically by merging pairs of states. Let's say we start with an HMM with K states. The idea is that we'll try merging every pair of states and see which merge makes the log-likelihood of the data go down the least. Once we find that pair, we have K-1 states, and we repeat this process until we have satisfactorily few states.\n",
